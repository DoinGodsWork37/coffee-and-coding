# Coffee & Coding
### _24/08/2018_

A repo to hold resources and notes from coffee-and-coding sessions. Get in touch at: coffee.coding@dft.gov.uk

### Contributing 
When adding new content work on a branch and submit a pull request. Note that resources are publicly accessible.

Folders should adhere to the following conventions:

* `YYYYMMDD_Topic_Name`
* All folders should contain a `README.md` with notes or a brief explanation

### Aim
The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at DfT. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within DfT who are interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other and generally network and get to know each other. The format is generally 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the presenter/s followed by 20 minutes Code Surgery. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. From time to time we will invite external speakers. The Code Surgery provides the opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered coding community.

### The History of Coffee & Coding
Coffee & Coding was started by Joe Elliston of BEIS around 2014/2015 after he had completed the GDS Data Science Accelerator. To begin with it was just a few (often less than half a dozen) people meeting up at one of the tables in the BEIS basement near the coffee shop (hence the ‘coffee’) to chat about coding issues they were having. At some point in 2016 this was formalised into the current iteration of about 40 minutes on a topic and 20 minutes for more general discussion or people asking advice on specific issues.

These sessions were a huge success and rumour of them soon reached other departments. Notably DfE colleagues began attending the BEIS Coffee & Coding sessions. This was very much encouraged, until numbers began to overwhelm the BEIS facilities. At this point a couple of regular attendees from DfE, Matt Dray and Tamsin Forbes, decided it was time to start their own Coffee & Coding. This coincided just about nicely with the completion of the digital modernisation at DfE so sessions were able to be broadcast over Skype, enabling virtual attendance. Everyone at DfE was also issued with personal tablets or laptops enabling sessions to take the form of workshops where desired, and removing the requirement for a projector/monitor as everyone could follow the materials on their own machine. Once again these session were hugely popular.

In September 2017 Tamsin Forbes moved to DfT, and having been part of a thriving coding community at DfE, naturally looked for a similar thing at DfT. Unfortunately there was, as yet, no Coffee & Coding analogue at DfT, there was also no ‘just completed’ digital modernisation. However, a group of R coders did meet, semi-regularly in the DfT basement, near the coffee shop… It took a while, but the interest was certainly there and finally Coffee & Coding made its DfT debut in June 2018.
